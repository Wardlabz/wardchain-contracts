# Soroban Escrow Contract Reference

This document provides a technical reference for the on-chain Soroban escrow contract (located in `contracts/escrow`). It details the contract interface, lifecycle, storage model, roles, events, error codes, and testing procedures.

---

## 1. Contract Overview & Lifecycle

The contract implements a **single-release milestone-based escrow** system. It uses a factory-instance pattern where new escrow contracts can be dynamically deployed and managed.

### Escrow Factory vs. Instance
* **Factory Deployment (`tw_new_single_release_escrow`)**: Deploys a new instance of the contract using `deploy_v2` with a salt and initialization arguments. This allows platforms to dynamically spawn independent escrow instances for each transaction/engagement.
* **Escrow Instance**: An individual deployed contract configured with its own roles, milestones, and funding status.

## 2. Public Interface Reference

All exported functions in `EscrowContract` (`contracts/escrow/src/contract.rs`) are documented below:

| Function | Authorized Signer(s) | Preconditions | Emitted Event(s) | REST API / SDK Equivalent |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `tw_new_single_release_escrow` | `signer` | The contract must not already have an escrow stored. | None (invokes init functions internally) | `/escrow/single-release/v2/deploy` (Factory part) |
| `initialize_escrow` | None (Typically Deployer) | Must not be already initialized. Flags must be false. Milestones must not be empty and <= 50. Platform fee + 0.3% WardChain fee must be <= 100%. | `InitEsc` (`tw_init`) | `/escrow/single-release/v2/deploy` (Init part) |

| `release_funds` | `release_signer` | Escrow not already released/resolved. `release_signer` matches stored `roles.release_signer`. Escrow not disputed. All milestones are approved. Contract holds enough tokens. | `DisEsc` (`tw_release`) | `/escrow/single-release/v2/release` |
| `update_escrow` | `platform` | `platform` matches `roles.platform`. Escrow not disputed. Platform address cannot be changed. Flags in updated properties must be false. See property immutability below. | `ChgEsc` (`tw_update`) | `/escrow/single-release/v2/update` |
| `get_escrow` | Public Read | Escrow must be initialized. | None | `/escrow/single-release/v2/get` |
| `get_escrow_by_contract_id` | Public Read | Target contract exists and supports `get_escrow`. | None | - |
| `get_multiple_escrow_balances` | Public Read | Input address array length <= 20. | None | - |
| `extend_contract_ttl` | `platform` | `platform` matches stored `roles.platform`. | `ExtTtlEvt` (`tw_ttl_extend`) | - |
| `change_milestone_status` | `service_provider` | `service_provider` matches stored `roles.service_provider`. Valid milestone index. Status cannot be empty. | `MilestoneStatusChanged` (`tw_ms_change`) | `/escrow/single-release/v2/milestone/status` |
| `approve_milestone` | `approver` | `approver` matches stored `roles.approver`. Valid index. Milestone not already approved. Status is not empty. | `MilestoneApproved` (`tw_ms_approve`) | `/escrow/single-release/v2/milestone/approve` |
| `dispute_escrow` | Any role except Dispute Resolver | `signer` matches one of the roles (approver, provider, platform, release_signer, receiver). Escrow not disputed/resolved. | `EscrowDisputed` (`tw_dispute`) | `/escrow/single-release/v2/dispute` |
| `resolve_dispute` | `dispute_resolver` | `dispute_resolver` matches `roles.dispute_resolver`. Escrow must be disputed. Distributions length <= 50. Total distribution matches contract balance exactly. All values > 0. | `DisputeResolved` (`tw_disp_resolve`) | `/escrow/single-release/v2/dispute/resolve` |
| `withdraw_remaining_funds` | `dispute_resolver` | `dispute_resolver` matches `roles.dispute_resolver`. Escrow is released, resolved, or disputed. Total <= current balance. All amounts > 0. | None | - |

### Escrow Property Immutability in `update_escrow`
* **If Contract has Funds (Balance > 0)**: All metadata fields, roles, amount, and existing milestones are locked. The platform can **only append new unapproved milestones** (milestone index >= old milestone count) up to the limit of 50.
* **If Contract has No Funds (Balance = 0)**: Properties can be modified, but no milestone (existing or new) can be marked as approved.

## 3. Storage & Roles Reference

### Storage Structures (`storage/types.rs`)

#### `Escrow`
```rust
pub struct Escrow {
    pub engagement_id: String,
    pub title: String,
    pub roles: Roles,
    pub description: String,
    pub amount: i128,
    pub platform_fee: u32,
    pub milestones: Vec<Milestone>,
    pub flags: Flags,
    pub trustline: Trustline,
    pub receiver_memo: u32,
}
```

#### `Milestone`
```rust
pub struct Milestone {
    pub description: String,
    pub status: String,
    pub evidence: String,
    pub approved: bool,
}
```

### System Roles
* **`approver`**: Typically the Client. Has authority to approve milestones.
* **`service_provider`**: Typically the freelancer/worker performing the task. Submits progress updates and evidence.
* **`platform`**: The specific platform instance integrating WardChain. Receives the platform fee, can modify milestones when contract holds no funds, and can extend contract TTL.
* **`release_signer`**: An address (often a platform hot wallet or oracle) authorized to sign off and release the earnings once all milestones are approved.
* **`dispute_resolver`**: The arbiter responsible for resolving disputes. Cannot dispute the escrow themselves.
* **`receiver`**: The recipient of funds upon release (usually matches the `service_provider`).

### Fee Calculations & Limits
* **WardChain Fee**: 0.3% (30 BPS) of the total amount.
* **Platform Fee**: Configurable up to 99% (9900 BPS).
* **Limit**: The sum of `platform_fee` BPS + 30 BPS must not exceed 100% (10,000 BPS).

## 6. Local Development & Testing

### How to Run Tests
The test suite utilizes the standard Rust testing toolchain. You must run the tests from the workspace root or the `contracts/escrow` subdirectory.

```bash
# From the repository root
cargo test

# From contracts/escrow
cargo test
```

### Test Directory Map (`contracts/escrow/src/tests`)
* **`helpers.rs`**: Setup utilities for creating mock Soroban test environments, generating mock addresses, and deploying test token instances.
* **`escrow.rs`**: Verifies factory deployment (`tw_new_single_release_escrow`), initialization (`initialize_escrow`), platform updates (`update_escrow`), and TTL extensions (`extend_contract_ttl`).
* **`fund.rs`**: Tests funding validation (`fund_escrow`), release validation (`release_funds`), standard fee calculations, and payouts.
* **`milestone.rs`**: Validates milestone state changes (`change_milestone_status`) and client approval logic (`approve_milestone`).
* **`dispute.rs`**: Covers dispute flag transitions (`dispute_escrow`), dispute resolution payouts (`resolve_dispute`), and remaining funds retrieval (`withdraw_remaining_funds`).
* **`balance.rs`**: Validates batch contract balance queries (`get_multiple_escrow_balances`).
